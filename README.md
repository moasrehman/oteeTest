# oteeTest: How Many Squares?

## Description
This project calculates the total number of axis-aligned/ diagonal squares (precomputed upto 10) in an `n x n` grid.

## Build Instructions

```bash
mkdir build && cd build

- CUnit (install with `sudo apt install libcunit1-dev` on Ubuntu)


## Task
Task Description
You are asked to provide a solution to the “How many squares?” problem. On an
infinite lattice you are given an n x n square, for an arbitrary value of n. How many
squares can you see? For instance: for n = 1 we can see one square, for n = 2 we
can see 5 squares, and so on.
Provide a solution to the problem, including:
1. The source code to your solution and relevant commentary.
2. Unit tests to the code
3. A build environment using a tool relevant to your chosen language.
Coding Tool: You can use any preferred coding tool to create your solution.
Submission Requirements
1. A link to the repository with the solution
2. Be prepared to discuss the solution and review it

Latest submission date: 2-3 days
